## Application Name:

My Day Web Application


## Project Objective:

MyDay is an online journal for an individual to save and keep track of their day-to-day activities or memories securely. This website is designed for those users with a habit of writing book/offline diary, to use at their convenience. They can access this website from anywhere to make an entry or view their entries securely anytime without having to carry a book diary.

Technologies Used: Html, Css, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, MongoDB, Mongoose, NodeJS, Express.



## Motivation:

The main motivation behind this app is, that this is a combination of things that I always wanted at one place but could never have it. A user doesnâ€™t have to go to multiple apps to write a diary or look back at a memory or create a checklist(album and to-do checklist are future functionalities). This is highly useful for people who wants to organize their day to day activities. On top of it, this app is accessible anywhere over internet with a personal authentication.
