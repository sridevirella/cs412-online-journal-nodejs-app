# My Day Web Application

MyDay is an online journal for an individual to save and keep track of their day-to-day activities or memories securely. This website is designed for those users with a habit of writing book/offline diary, to use at their convenience. They can access this website from anywhere to make an entry or view their entries securely anytime without having to carry a book diary.

Design/Used Technologies: Html, Css, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, MongoDB, Mongoose, NodeJS, Express.

-	Using Bootstrap, JavaScript and Html, I built a fully responsive website, that is, it fits aesthetically to any screen size without cropping the UI elements.
-	It handles success, error messages and validations for all screens.
-	Only authorized users can access main features like journal entry, search and profile update.
-	The app uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store and retrieve journal data.
