## Application Name:

My Day Web Application


## Project Objective:

My Day, this is an online personal journal application. A user can use this application to save his personal diary entries, thoughts, memories and activities. This app enables them to go back to this journal and make changes to its daily. Their privacy is protected by a secured authentication and all the data is stored in secured database. It provides users an opportunity to organize their thought, reminders, tasks and to-dos. This app mainly features three options. First, they can maintain a journal, secondly, they can set reminders or to-do lists and finally they can save photos on this app. This app also lands on a beautiful memories page as home page, which displays their best memories based on their actions in this app. They are welcomes probably with an achievement they have completed, or a beautiful photo taken on a day or some information marked by user to check back later.


## Motivation:

The main motivation behind this app is, that this is a combination of things that I always wanted at one place but could never have it. A user doesnâ€™t have to go to multiple apps to write a diary or look back at a memory or create a checklist. This is highly useful for people who wants to organize their day to day activities. On top of it, this app is accessible anywhere over internet with a personal authentication. I believe this app has a potential to add un more features as it developed but as I see it, I find it as a wonderful start with this motivation.


## Server-Side Components:

1.	User Authentication: A server-side authentication for users to login to application.
    It saves the unique a) user id b) password and c) associated email address. 

2.	Personal data entered into journal: Save personal information as texts in database.

3.	Checklist Data: Store into the database as texts.

4.	Photos: Store Images into the database as blobs and user input data about photo such as image taken date and description.
